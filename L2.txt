2nd level:
teach me numbers in mandarin from 1 to 10
I have to answer 5 simple questions regarding numbers in mandarin
provide hints at the beginning of the question
if I answered wrongly, give an explanation
for example, you can ask what is one in mandarin and give 3 options for me to choose from
A 一
B 二
C 十
and if I answered the right answer, ask the next questions.
if the answer is wrong, explain why it is wrong.
Once 5 questions are answered, I am allowed to enter a room to find the house deed.
